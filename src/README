gd - Goto Directory
===================

gd will let you change to a subdirectory within your personal
home-directory tree just by specifying parts of the directory name. It
is inspired by old versions (with no tree-visualizer) of Norton Change
Directory for M$-DOS. To work as expected, the user will have to
install a shell-alias or -function. Please see the manual pages for
end user installation.

The program is written in perl by
