Installing gd
=============

Note that this describes system level installation. Each user will
have to make a shell-alias or -function to use gd. Please see the
manual pages for how to do that.

Installing gd is quite simple, just copy `gdprog' to some
bin-directory, and `gd.1' and `gdprog.1' to a matching
man/man1-directory.

You may also execute `make install'. This will install `gdprog' in
/usr/local/bin, and `gd.1' and `gdprog.1' in /usr/local/man/man1.
