# GD Graphics (Draw) Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/libgd/libgd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/libgd/libgd)

GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images by
programmers.

GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP and other
languages. GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among other
formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and
most anything else, on the fly.

The most common applications of GD involve website development, although it
can be used with any standalone application!

The library was originally developed by Thomas Boutell and is now maintained
by many contributors (see the CONTRIBUTORS file) under the umbrella of PHP.net.
